  which-chapter: 3) Elements
  tut-content: 
    - text-bold-200%: Elements
    - In your index.yml file you'll notice the line
    - code: "- Your fresh new BHTML website."
    - This is short for
    - code: "- text: Your fresh new BHTML website."
    - >
        In BetterHTML, everything that shows up on your page is an element. The above
        element is a "text" element. Elements have "attributes", try this:
    - code: "- text (color blue) (font-size 200%): Hello, world."
    - $$ template tutorial-box:
        content:
          - text (color blue) (font-size 200%): Hello, world.
    - >
        You'll see that your text is now blue and two times the size of normal text.
        BetterHTML also lets you use "options" - an even more convenient way of 
        customizing your elements. Place your options after the element name using
        dashes:
    - code: "- text-200%-italic (color blue): Hello, world."
    - $$ template tutorial-box:
        content:
          - text-200%-italic (color blue): Hello, world.
    - >
        Sometimes you have too many options to include in one line. You can make your
        code more readable by breaking it into multiple lines:
    - code: |
        - text-italic:
            font-size: 200%
            color: blue
            content: Hello, world.
    - >
        And if your text is too long, you can use a special character ">" or "|" to 
        make it span over multiple lines:
    - code: |
        - text: >
            This text is too long to fit
            on a single line, so I'll
            break it up into multiple
            lines, but it'll appear normal.
    - "There are several different elements you can use, like an image:"
    - code: "- img (src /beach.jpg)"
    - $$ template tutorial-box:
        content:
          - img (src /beach.jpg)
    - >
        You can also create code blocks like this one below, which shows the code to
        create a code block element:
    - code: |
        - code: |
            This is a code block!
            Type some code.
    - results in...
    - $$ template tutorial-box:
        content:
          - code: |
              This is a code block!
              Type some code.

        A really useful element is the "container" - it acts like an HTML "div" or
        "span", and lets you group together other elements. Here are two examples
        of containers. The second one is easier to read because we split up the 
        options and attributes into new lines.
    - code: |
        - container-centered (background-color pink) (border-radius 10px) (padding 10px):
            - text-bold: Bold text.
            - text-150%-italic: Large italic text.
        - hr
        - container:
            background-color: yellow
            border-radius: 10px
            padding: 10px
            option: centered
            content:
              - text-bold: Bold text.
              - text-150%-italic: Large italic text.
    - $$ template tutorial-box:
        content:
          - container (width 1/2) (offset 1/4):
            - container-centered (background-color pink) (border-radius 10px) (padding 10px):
                - text-bold: Bold text.
                - text-150%-italic: Large italic text.
            - hr
            - container:
                background-color: yellow
                border-radius: 10px
                padding: 10px
                option: centered
                content:
                  - text-bold: Bold text.
                  - text-150%-italic: Large italic text.

        You can use the "hr" element from above to create a "horizontal rule", and
        the "br" element to add a line break.

        Now that you know the building blocks of BetterHTML, you're ready to learn
        [the grid system](/tutorial/4-grids.html).
