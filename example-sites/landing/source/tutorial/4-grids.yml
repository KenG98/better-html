        One of the best features of BetterHTML is the grid system. Grids help you get the
        perfect layout for your page and make it mobile-friendly. Many HTML frameworks
        have grids, but this one is especially easy to use.
    - code: |
        - row: 
          - Column 1
          - Column 2
          - Column 3
    - "On desktops, you'll see three vertical columns:"
    - $$ template tutorial-box:
        content:
          - row-centered-nonresponsive: 
              - Column 1
              - Column 2
              - Column 3
    - "But on mobile, the columns will stack so that they're readable:"
    - $$ template tutorial-box:
        content:
          - container-centered:
            - Column 1
            - Column 2
            - Column 3
    - >
        If you don't want your columns to stack on mobile, use the "row-nonresponsive"
        option on the row element.

        Use a "column" element to put multiple elements in each column. You can give
        your columns attributes, and you can specify different widths for them.
    - code: |
        - row-nonresponsive:
          - column (width 1/3) (background-color pink):
            - container (padding 10px):
              - This column is 1/3 width.
              - It has multiple elements.
              - img (src /beach.jpg)
          - column (width 2/3) (background-color lightblue):
            - container (padding 10px):
              - This one has a width of 2/3
              - It doesn't have much else.

                - This column is 1/3 width.
                - It has multiple elements.
                - img (src /beach.jpg)
            - column (width 2/3) (background-color lightblue):
              - container (padding 10px):
                - This one has a width of 2/3
                - It doesn't have much else.

        You can also use a container with a "width" and "offset", and BetterHTML will use
        the grid under the hood:
    - code: |
        - container (width 1/3) (offset 1/3):
            background-color: pink
            padding: 10px
            border-radius: 10px
            content:
              This is a container with a width and offset.

              background-color: pink
              padding: 10px
              border-radius: 10px
              content:
                This is a container with a width and offset.

        but the code we've written so far can still look better. Check out the
