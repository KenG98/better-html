  tut-content: 
    - text-bold-200%: Your First Website
    - To create your first project, run
    - code: bhtml init site-one
    - >
        This creates a folder "site-one" with your website files (a build and source folder,
        as well as some basic code). Here's what it looks like:
    - code: |
        site-one
        -- build
        -- source
        ---- index.yml
        ---- parameters.yml
        ---- settings.yml
        ---- styles.yml
        ---- templates.yml
    - >
        Now you'll want to view your website. From outside of the site-one folder, 
        type these two commands:
    - code: |
        bhtml generate site-one
        bhtml serve site-one
    - >
        The first command will generate an HTML website from your BetterHTML code, and the
        second command will serve the website on your localhost so that you can view it.
        Visit "localhost:8080" in your browser to view the website.
    - >
        The "index.yml" file contains the code for the home page of your website. To
        update your site, change the file, save it, run the above two commands again, 
        and refresh the page. 
    - 'BetterHTML can also do the above for you automatically with the "watch" command:'
    - code: bhtml watch site-one
    - >
        When bhtml is watching your project, you can simply change and save your file,
        then refresh the page to see the updates.
    - You run "watch" once and bhtml will continue re-generating your project until you quit it.

        code your first site.
