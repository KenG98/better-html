        - text-bold-150%: About BetterHTML
        - text: >
            BetterHTML was created out of frustration with the current ways of 
            creating responsive web pages. HTML is verbose (angle brackets and 
            closing tags), easy to mess up, and is low level - you need to describe 
            explicitly how every part of your page looks.
        - text: >
            While modern responsive frameworks work well and take some of the pain 
            away, they're still cumbersome to write with, and users still need to 
            deal with HTML.
        - text: >
            BetterHTML compiles YAML markup, using PureCSS and our language 
            specification to create a mobile friendly site for the user.
        - text-bold-150%: Should You Use BetterHTML?
        - text: >
            BetterHTML is great for static websites - YAML, the markup language 
            that it uses, is easy to write and read, giving you an enjoyable 
            editing experience.
        - text: >
            It's also great if you need to write something quickly - it takes 
            the labor and guesswork out of creating good looking and responsive 
            sites.
        - text: >
            Use BetterHTML if you don't need extremely fine grained control and 
            would rather have a desktop and mobile friendly website without the 
            labor of the more complicated frameworks already out there.
        - text-bold-150%: Active Development
        - text: >
            BetterHTML is under active development. Things are changing quickly 
            and sometimes break backwards compatibility. It's safe to say that 
            it is in an Alpha.
